##Overview
HEBench is designed to be a flexible, extendable, intuitive and reliable framework for testing and evaluating homomorphic encryption software and hardware solutions. It defines an abstraction API in C to enable integration with the widest variety of hardware and software and executes high level tests using a front end application which feeds data to supported HE backends through the APIBridge component, generating detailed performance reports and verifying the accuracy of the returned results. 

##Features
 - Support for a wide range of software and hardware through highly flexible C API.
 - Automatic test data generation and results verification
 - Comprehensive performance metric report generation
 - Dynamic backend loading for easy comparison. 
 - Includes front end support for a wide range of tests of interest to the Homomorphic Encryption space such as
     - Matrix Multiplication
     - Element wise vector vector addition.

##Project Architecture

  <span>Figure 1. : HEBench architecture diagram</span>
</div>
Figure 1 above shows a high level diagram of the project architecture and the its components. We further seperate these components into what we call the frontend and backend components based upon how we expect users will interact with the project. Details on the backend and frontend are described in detail on their respective overview pages.

##HEBench Backend
The HEBench backend is where the API and helper classes for interfacing with different homomorphic encryption (HE) hardware and software are defined.

<b>Submitters</b> are the primary users expected to interface with the HEBench project. Submitters create backends for HEBench by implementing the specified API for any subset of existing benchmarks already defined in the frontend.

Users interested in submitting their solution to the existing HE benchmarks should start here.

- @ref backend_overview : provides details on the backend including components, and detailed information on how to add new backend and test implementations for HE software and hardware.

##HEBench Frontend
The HEBench frontend is where HE tests are defined, scheduled for execution, and results collected by the Test Harness.

<b>Collaborators</b> are expected to primarily extend the components of the Test Harness
by implementing new tests and adding new workloads.

Users interested in collaborating and adding new benchmarks to the frontend should start here.

- @ref frontend_overview : provides details on the frontend including components, how to use, supported tests, and how to extend it.
	
##HEBench Component namespace quick references 
This section provides links to the core components and sections of the HEBench project. 
 - The API Bridge specifices the C API which testing backends are required to implement. It is defined in the hebench::APIBridge namespace. 
     - [API Bridge namespace reference](@ref hebench::APIBridge)
 - The HEBench C++ wrapper is a helper library which wraps the C API Bridge in a set of helper C++ classes to make it easier to implement backends. The classes and components of this module are defined under the hebench::cpp namespace. 
     - [HEBench C++ wrapper namespace reference](@ref hebench::cpp)
 - The test harness implements and executes tests which are executed on supporting backends which implement the APIBridge API. The test harness and implemented tests are defined under the hebench::TestHarness namespace. 
     - [Test Harness namespace reference](@ref hebench::TestHarness)
